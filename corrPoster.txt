What they are

	our correlations range from -1 to 1
	positive correlation - two values increase at the same time
	negative correlation - one value increases while the other decreases
	zero correlation - one value increases while the other sometimes increases 				   and sometimes decreases

How we use them

	we use correlations to tell us how much two datasets behave like eachother
